We support user authentication, 1-click device enrollment that works with macOS, Linux, Windows, iOS/iPadOS and Android including QR codes. Furthermore, you can choose from different network isolation modes for a better control over connected devices. Generally speaking you can customize the project to your use-case with relative ease. This project aims to provide a simple VPN solution for developers, homelab enthusiasts, and anyone else who is adventurous. This is a fork of the original work of place1, maintained by Freifunk Munich . Since the upstream is currently unmaintained, we try to add new features and keep the project up to date and in a working state. This fork supports IPv6. The VPN can run in dual-stack, IPv6-only or IPv4-only mode. NAT can be disabled separately for IPv4 and IPv6. Contributions are always welcome so that we can offer new bug fixes, features and improvements to the users of this project .

You have to call the webfrontent of the project for this. Normally, this is done via the IP address of the device or server on which the wg-access-server is running followed by the standard port 8000, via which the web interface can be reached. For most deployments something like this should work: http://192.168.0.XX:8000 If the project is running locally on the computer, you can easily connect to the web interface by connecting to http://localhost:8000 in the browser. Running on Kubernetes via Helm \u00b6 wg-access-server ships a Helm chart to make it easy to get started on Kubernetes. Here's a quick start, but you can read more at the Helm Chart Deployment Docs # deploy helm install my-release --repo https://freifunkMUC.github.io/wg-access-server wg-access-server # cleanup helm delete my-release Running with Docker-Compose \u00b6 Download the the docker-compose.yml file from the repo and run the following command. export WG_ADMIN_PASSWORD = \"example\" export WG_WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY = \" $( wg genkey ) \" docker-compose up You can connect to the web server on the local machine browser at http://localhost:8000 If you open your browser to your machine's LAN IP address you'll be able to connect your phone using the UI and QR code! Screenshots \u00b6 Changelog \u00b6 See the CHANGELOG.md file Development \u00b6 The software consists of a Golang server and a React app. If you want to make changes to the project locally, you can do so relatively easily with the following steps. Run cd website && npm install && npm start to get the frontend running on :3000 . Run sudo go run ./main.go to get the server running on :8000 . Here are some notes on development configuration: sudo is required because the server uses iptables/ip to configure the VPN network access to the website is on :3000 and API requests are redirected to :8000 thanks to webpack in-memory storage and generated WireGuard keys are used gRPC code generation: The client communicates with the server via gRPC web. You can edit the API specification in ./proto/*.proto . After changing a service or message definition, you must regenerate the server and client code using: ./codegen.sh .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#wg-access-server","text":"wg-access-server is a single binary file that contains a WireGuard VPN server and a web user interface for device management.

The database file will be written to /data/db.sqlite3 within the container by default. Sqlite3 is probably the simplest storage backend to get started with because it doesn't require any additional setup to be done.

Example connection string: postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database?sslmode=disable Mysql \u00b6 This backend requires an external Mysql database to be deployed.

Note that the migration tool itself doesn't support the file:// backend on versions released after 0.3.0 . Migration Between Backends \u00b6 You can migrate your registered devices between backends using the wg-access-server migrate <src> <dest> command. The migrate command was added in v0.3.0 and is provided on a best effort level. As an open source project any community support here is warmly welcomed. Example: file:// to sqlite3:// \u00b6 If you're using the now deprecated file:// backend you can migrate to sqlite3:// like this: # after upgrading to place1/wg-access-server:v0.3.0 docker exec -it <container-name> wg-access-server migrate file:///data sqlite3:///data/db.sqlite3 If you need to do the above within a kubernetes deployment substitute docker exec with the equivalent kubectl exec command. The migrate command is non-destructive but it's always a good idea to take a backup of your data first!
